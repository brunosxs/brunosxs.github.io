the year I've been in an always-learning process while making my game\nand interacting with a lot of incredible individuals in many fields.\nI've also experienced quite a lot of game engines, frameworks, courses,\nbooks and all-things related to game development, be it the game-design\nside of things, the marketing, narrative methods, scripts... So, I'd\nlike to help people with a kind of list of some of the resources and\nindividuals that I found really helpful overall.\nThe list is of course, handled in a loose way, with no particular order, and\nI am very prone of forgetting things, so I do plan on updating and\ncorrecting it to do justice to all of the content.\nBasic tools:\nCodeacademy's git\ncourse&nbsp;GIT is\neverywhere in gamedevelopment, and for a very good reason.

This time around, the theme was \"One Room\".\nI thought to myself: \"OK! I &nbsp;got this!\"\nNo I didn't...\nPresenting ROOM JUDGE(working title) - And how an apparent concrete idea can go wrong with lofty sense of scale and complexity...\nThe idea: Making a game where you as the player would furnish the room\nand then, be judged from it. Inspired by The Sims' original concept(A\nfurnishing game, on which the sims played pretty much the same roles as\nthe judges of my game).\n\n\nMockup of the ui\n\nBut for me the game was not about furnishing, it was more about how\nthose judges would react to the decoration. I thought a lot about its\nmechanics and was sure I could have made something good out of it. Even\nthe graphics(the thing I suck the most) were coming nicely. The\nbird's-view perspective was also to make things simpler to draw and\nanimate.\n\n\nThe first of the 5 judges\n\nAs you can pretty much get from the title, this was too much for me to\nchew.\n\n\nAlthough most of the graphics were static, the sheer quantity I had to drawn took me &nbsp;a lot longer than I thought originally.\n\nThis was a big planning error. It was not the biggest, but ultimately\nkilled the project.\nThe very first 24 hours were dedicated to the graphics alone, I\ngenerally start with the engine, test, tweak and then move to the\ngraphics(sometimes doing the music first), but as I had everything I\nthought I needed written on my tablet the night prior, I thought I could\nstart by the worst part for me.\nThe problem is, during the second day, early in the morning I was\nstarting to see that, to make the game work as a game, mainly to be fun\nas I envisioned, I would have needed a lot more time to tweak the\nengine. At the state it was, while working, it simply wasn't fun.&nbsp;\n\n\nThe idea of a VS Screen and an intro kinda like a fighting game stuck into me. I also am guilty of having a lot of fun making the characters personalities and wasting precious time that should have been used first on the engine.\n\nSo, by mid-sunday I was in a dire spot, realizing the mistakes I made\nsince the very begining, and everything kinda went downhill from there.\nThe lesson here is: You're never as ready as you think you are in\nbringing a project to life. Be reasonable with your\nminimal-viable-product.\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2016-12-19-to-bite-more-than-you-can-chew-another-ludum-dare-37-dev-story-of-missteps/","title":"To bite more than you can chew: Another Ludum Dare 37 dev story of missteps"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-01-27-update-to-smrt-godot/":{"body":"Just updated SMRT-Godot with some bugfixes and changes after some months\ncompiling feedback.\nWhat is SMRT-Godot?\nIt is a dialog system for your games, written as a plugin for godot that\nenables you to create classic dialog boxes with a lot of\npersonalization.\nSee it in action:\nI have just sent this new version to godot's assetlib, so it is probably\nnot updated there, but on the repo you can find the latest version and\nsome examples.\nSMRT-Godot is licensed under MIT.\nGo to the repo\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-01-27-update-to-smrt-godot/","title":"Update to SMRT-Godot"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-02-14-godot-engine-quick-tips-01-create-timer-helper-for-yielding-a-script/":{"body":"]\nImplemented during the middle of last year(or at least publicly\nannounced by the devs) was a small but really useful feature that was\noverlooked by me at the time thanks to the rapid evolutionary pace of\nGodot, it is a an optional way to yield the script for an amount of\ntime.\nThere are basically two ways of doing it: You could either create the\ntimer in the editor and access it through code or you could create it\nall trough code at runtime as I did in the gist.\nIt essentially makes the 5 lines of code go down to 1, which helps a lot\nin code organization.\nThe only downside: It is not available on the stable branch yet(at\nthe moment: 2.1.2) but you can get it on the 2.2-legacy branch or in the\nmaster branch of godot.\nSee the gist, from line 5 to 14 I wrote the code using the default way,\nand from line 21 to 23 we see the same thing with the new\ncreate_timer() function:\n\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-02-14-godot-engine-quick-tips-01-create-timer-helper-for-yielding-a-script/","title":"Godot Engine Quick Tips - 01: create_timer() helper for yielding a script"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-02-18-signals-in-godot/":{"body":"    Understanding signals in godot game engine by brunosxs  from Bruno Sxs  \n\nDownload the examples\n\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-02-18-signals-in-godot/","title":"Signals in godot"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-05-21-godot-engine-quick-tips-02-simple-save-and-load-methods-for-godot-engine-with-dir-and-file-handling/":{"body":"Now I share with you guys how I handle save files in games.

They represent the same\nconcept of chapters in a book: A new point in the story. So they can say\ndifferent things, while keeping the same dialog names with just a change\nin chapter\nWe will focus basically on the code for the following:\n\nThis is the final scene tree\n\nWorld: It will be very simple, just setting the initial\nconditions for the rest of the scene through the use of Globals\n\n\n\nTransition: A simple transition that will be played at a\nspecific time later on.\n\n\n\nPlayer's avatar: With simple 8 directions movement.\n\n\n\nNPC node:&nbsp;That can detect if the player entered its interactive\narea and say things. to the player.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA trigger: Basically an instance of the npc node with no sprite.\nIt will be initially blocked by an NPC. When the player enters its\narea, a cutscene will play, and at the end of this cutscene, the\nchapter will change.\n\nFor SMRT to work properly, it should be a child of a CanvasLayer.\nSMRT also needs a language file, it is a JSON that has info on how it\nshould display messages.\nI created an editor for this process, access it by clicking on the\nfollowing button:\n\nClick on SMRT-Editor\nUse the load button and navigate to res://examples/cave to\nload&nbsp;another_example.lan\n\nClick in a chapter to display all available dialogs in the dialog's\nviewer, then click in one of the texts to edit its properties. For\nactions, you can add, duplicate, edit and delete chapters and dialogs\nwhile you can add, duplicate, delete and change the order of the texts\nwith the arrows bellow the text field.\nCareful! There is no confirmation for deleting anything. So if you do\nsomething you didn't meant to, providing you haven't saved it yet, just\nload the file again.\nThe transition\n\nIt's setup:\n\n\nIt is a texture of 64x64 pixels that covers the entire viewport, with\ntwo keyframes for opacity: It starts at 0 and ends at 1.\nThe world\n\nThe most important line is the forth one. On it, we create a global\nvariable called 'chapter' with the value 'intro'.&nbsp;\nIn the script for the npcs this value will be used and changed as\ndesired.\nLines 5 and 6 are basically SMRT and a fade transition node\nrespectively.\nThe player\n\nJust simple movement, our player class will be passive, it will not have\nthe methods to interact with objects by itself, this will be the work of\nthe NPC node.\nTake note of line 7: This is how we will identify what character is the\nplayer for our NPCs.\nextends KinematicBody2D\n\nvar walk_speed = 500\nvar direction = Vector2(0,0)\nfunc _ready():\n\tset_fixed_process(true)\n\tGlobals.set(\"player\", self) # We make the player accessible more easily through Globals.\n\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\n\t# Simple movement for our char\n\tif Input.is_action_pressed(\"player_up\"):\n\t\tdirection.y = -1\n\telif Input.is_action_pressed(\"player_down\"):\n\t\tdirection.y = 1\n\telif Input.is_action_pressed(\"player_left\"):\n\t\tdirection.x = -1\n\telif Input.is_action_pressed(\"player_right\"):\n\t\tdirection.x = 1\n\telse:\n\t\tdirection = Vector2(0,0)\t\n\tmove(direction*walk_speed*delta)\n\nThe NPC\n\nIt is a duplicate of the player char &nbsp;with an Area2D for the interactive\narea.\nextends KinematicBody2D\n\n\nvar direction = Vector2(0,0)\nexport var dialog_name = \"FRIEND_TALK\"\nexport var start_at_message = 0\nvar can_interact = true\n\nfunc _ready():\n\tget_node(\"interactive_area\").connect(\"body_enter\",self, \"on_body_enter\")\n\tpass\n\n\nfunc on_body_enter(body):\n\tif body == Globals.get(\"player\"): # Check if the character that entered is the player\n\t\tif dialog_name != null or dialog_name != \"\" and can_interact: # check if the npc has something to say and we can interact with\n\t\t\tcan_interact = false # make the npc non-interactive during the talk\n\t\t\t# using some variables to shorten the burden of writing\n\t\t\tvar smrt = Globals.get(\"dialog\")\n\t\t\tvar chapter = Globals.get(\"chapter\")\n\t\t\tGlobals.get(\"player\").set_fixed_process(false) # We disable the player while the dialog happen\n\t\t\tsmrt.show_text(chapter, dialog_name, start_at_message) # Start the dialog\n\t\t\t# we can connect to the signal 'dialog_control' and do different things based on the current state of the dialog\n\t\t\tif not smrt.is_connected(\"dialog_control\",self,\"on_dialog\"):\n\t\t\t\tsmrt.connect(\"dialog_control\",self,\"on_dialog\")\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tyield(smrt,\"finished\") # wait for smrt to emit the finished signal so we can continue\n\t\t\tcan_interact = true # re-enable the npc interactiveness\n\t\t\tsmrt.disconnect(\"dialog_control\",self,\"on_dialog\")\n\t\t\tGlobals.get(\"player\").set_fixed_process(true) # And finally, re-enable the player\n\t\t\t\n\nfunc on_dialog(info):\n#\tinfo is a dictionary that sends the following:\n#\tanswer: if a question was answered, it will give the index of the button selected, otherwise it is null\n#\tchapter: the chapter currently active\n#\tdialog: the dialog currently active\n#\tlast_text_index: the index of the last text that was displayed\n#\ttotal_text: the number of texts in the currently active dialog\n\t\n\tvar smrt = Globals.get(\"dialog\") # Let's grab the dialog system into a 4 letter var\n\t\n\t# Check for an answer:\n\tif info.chapter == \"intro\": # it is good practice to also check what chapter and...\n\t\tif info.dialog == \"friend_talk\": # the dialog we're in\n\t\t\tif info.answer == 0: # There is only one question on this dialog, we check if the player answered \"Of course, I am fearless!\"\n\t\t\t\tsmrt.stop() # We kindly ask SMRT to stop\n\t\t\t\tyield(get_tree(),\"idle_frame\") # and wait one frame for it to patch things up and quit nicelly\n\t\t\t\tsmrt.show_text(\"intro\",\"friend_talk_positive\") # to finally follow it with a new dialog\n\t\t\t\tif test_move(Vector2(128,0)): # We will make the npc go out of the path\n\t\t\t\t\tmove(Vector2(-128,0))\n\t\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\t\tmove(Vector2(128,0))\n\t\t\t\tprint(\"changed dialog name from \", get_name())\n\t\t\t\tdialog_name = \"friend_talk_positive\" # We also change the dialog the npc will talk from now on so when the player interact with it from now on, it will show a new answer.\n\t\telif info.dialog == \"great_adventure\":\n\t\t\tvar transition = Globals.get(\"transition\") # Grab the transition node\n\t\t\tif info.last_text_index == 0: # When the first text finishes\n\t\t\t\ttransition.play(\"fade\") # we play a fade-to-black animation\n\t\t\telif info.last_text_index == info.total_text: # when the last dialog has finished\n\t\t\t\ttransition.play_backwards(\"fade\")  # we play the same animation, backwards\n\t\t\t\tGlobals.set(\"chapter\",\"after_going_there\") # change the chapter\n\t\t\t\tyield(transition,\"finished\") # wait for the transition to end\n\nThe variables from line 5 through 7 will dictate what the character will\nsay, based on the language file loaded in SMRT. Exporting them, allow\neach instance to have its own string. The NPC will be responsible to see\nif the player entered its interactive area, for that, we need to connect\nthe area2D to the npc.\nDoing it with the editor for one or two npcs is fine, but it is better\nto do it through code, this way we don't need to keep connecting areas\nto new npcs, This is done at _ready() in line 10.&nbsp;\nWe connect the interactive_area to the function \"on_body_enter\"\ninside the npc itself. This function first checks if the body that\nentered is the player, then see if the npc has something to say (the\ndialog_name is not empty nor null) and if it can interact.\nIf those conditions are met, we make can_interact false so we don't\nfire the event again until the dialog finishes, grab SMRT and the\nchapter in small variables(lines 19 and 20), stop the process of the\nplayer so he won't be able to move while the dialog happens (line 21)\nand finally call show_text(chapter, dialog_name, start_at).&nbsp;\nWith this, we have a basic interaction between player and npc. We can\npretty much make them say whatever we want. But the example is far from\nover...\nThe npc that is blocking the exit will ask a question and make things\nhappen based on it. &nbsp;This happens thanks to the signal\n\"dialog_control\". It can give us important info like the answer a\nplayer gave in a question.\nAt line 24, we check if the signal dialog_control is already\nconnected. If it isn't, we connect it to the npc's function\n*on_dialog.&nbsp;*\n\n\nfriend_talk is the first npc's dialog, the one blocking the exit of the cave\n\nThen, through lines 44 and 45 we check if we're in the \"intro\" chapter\nand if the dialog playing is \"friend_talk\", checking for the answer\nindex sent by SMRT. So we check for the first option to be clicked and\nmake the npc move out of the way. We also change the dialog the char\nwill say from now on to friend_talk_positive.\nIt may seem &nbsp;obvious, but you should handle what the answers will do. If\nyou don't code anything, SMRT will simply continue the dialog until the\nend, regardless of the answer selected. This is also why we don't check\nfor the negative option, as the dialog will simply continue to it.\nThe Trigger\nThe trigger is a duplicate of the npc. It behaves exactly like one with\nthe exception that it doesn't have a sprite set. Its dialog is set to\n\"great_adventure\".\nThis is also handled inside the npc's script. from line 56 to line 63.\nWhen the very first message of great_adventure finishes, the screen\nwill fade to black while the dialog continues. At the end of it, we\nchange the chapter global to \"after_going_there\"&nbsp;and life goes on.\nThe second NPC\n\n\n\nThis one just illustrates the&nbsp;usefulness of the chapter &gt; dialog\nparadigm. &nbsp;This npc will start the dialog \"that_guy_talk\".&nbsp;In the\nlanguage file, there exists two versions of \"that_guy_talk\", each in\nthe two different chapters.\nThis is all you need to do to make the same chars say different things\nbased on moments of the game.&nbsp;\nFinal thoughts\nThis can give you a pretty good foundation to work with SMRT in your\nprojects.\nI hope this helps you work on your game. I learned a lot thanks to\npeople writing articles, sharing knowledgement and directly helping me\nin my doubts. In a way, it is me continuing the cycle.\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2017-06-06-using-smrt-godot-the-dialog-system-with-a-fancy-name/","title":"Using SMRT-Godot - The dialog system with a fancy name"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2018-06-27-smrt-godot-legacy-and-the-future-of-smrt/":{"body":"SMRT-Godot is a plugin I made to create dialogs for my game (which has\nstill to come to life), over the course of almost two years now, I've\nbeen supporting it\nGodot community has grown a lot over the time I've been working on this\nlittle plugin, and I am happy to say that there are a lot of capable\nusers that can do and will do their own sollutions, be it based in past\nworks like mine, other friends' or even build something from scratch\n(which is really cool, you learn a lot).\nWell, I'm posting to announce that, the last update for SMRT-Godot for\nthe 2.x branch has been out for quite some time, but I had yet to port\nit to godot 3.0.

Living in Brazil limits my options and makes it VERY hard and expensive to buy good parts. I´d love to get myself a THREADRIPPER or an EPYC cpu, but I would pay 2.5 times the price. Yeah, living here is like a perpetual state of the GPU shortage we went through the pandemic, but for every gadget I´d like to get my hands on. This is the reason why I use consumer-grade parts, which in turn makes me have to do more maintenance than I would like.\nSo, during the last server breakdown caused by using a cheap mini-pc as the server, I started talking to my friend HP, core godot contributor and incidentally, my boss at prehensile-tales and they gave me the idea of just using containers for EVERYTHING, and with of course a more in-depth conversation they showed me that, provided I took time to set it up correctly, I could drastically reduce the downtime and work needed to maintain or reinstall everything. They also gave me clever tips for backup which I frankly would not have thought but were so simple to integrate and had such impact that I did it basically on the spot.\nChoosing the distro was simple, Fedora workstation has been my main OS for more than a year, god is my withness I even learned to like gnome thanks to that, which was something I haven´t touched since the bad days of gnome 3. Fedora had sane defaults on desktop so I decided to use fedora server for my server.\nWhat you will read here is the journalling of the process that started around April and frankly, has not finished to this day, but I´d like to leave a written registry for Bruno of the future and if this helps anyone in a similar situation, hey, that is great!\nRequirements &amp; Reasoning\nWhy do I have a server? \nWhy shouldn´t I have a server? It is a cool project, it can store my samples, recordings, old college assignments... it is my vault and a machine that works for me. But the non-tldr version is that it started because of cd rot on two of my favorite dreamcast games way back in 2003~4. From that point forward, I waste no time in having a private collection of my physical media... I take no time at all to rip in the most accurate way possible what I bought so I can have control of my things. Around the same time I started learning about compression algorithms, codecs and all of that jazz. Nowadays I have a good understanding and well, even before finishing high-school I had my simple debian DIY ATX server built as cheaply as possible and god only knows how my data survived throughout the years.\nSince 2014, my needs evolved a lot and, although I never went over 2TB of data, thanks to work I need to worry about resilience and backup strategies. I also started doing some automation in my home and I hate the fact that I depend on the cloud for that so that pushed me a bit more to start the project where I started.\nHaving said that, here are the key points of my requirements:\nEVERYTHING in containers\nStuff will break and nothing feels better than simply killing a container or completely cleaning the state of it and having a new working one in seconds.\nNo dependency on cloud services\nI care about my privacy that is why I use chrome and I like to understand why and where my things are where they are. This is why I still buy dvds and blu-rays in 2023 and let me tell you, nothing beats having the phisical media of something you like that may or may not have gone the way of the dodo on that streaming service. I have a small collection of movies and series I have bought throughout the years that I`d like to move with me no matter the machine.\nNot too much complexity and specialized tools\nI have already used portainer on my server but I have been in situations where I felt it limitting more than helpful. Where are the damn configs files of the tool? Where are the compose files I pasted in the webui to create my containers?  Why go through the initial setup and have to download and later upload a backup if needed? \nI have also used webmin for years and there were lots of things on it that I never touched. It felt like killing a fly with an atomic bomb. \nThis is why, this project will prefer CLI over any gui (also because of automation). \nUse the tools fedora already provides and try to keep the usage of external tools (that are not on the official repos) to a minimum\nVirtualization\nFor quick deployment of systems both for work and for testing purposes. Last thing I was playing with during my free-time was nix and nixos on a laptop. It would be ideal to have it on a vm that I can access on my network instead of that only machine, saving snapshots and whatnot would benefit my learning process...\nBTRFS\nI'm fairly used to BTRFS and can´t live without its snapshot feature. I´d like to keep using that.\nEfficient\nMy old nas (an odroid H2+ sbc) used to take 24w while idling and 35w on average when I was doing stuff with it. I will go with more power for virtualization but as I will be using a fairly recent ryzen cpu, I expect to not even double that power consumption.\nHardware:\n\nGigabyte Aorus B450m\nRyzen 5 5600G (later I do plan on switching for the GE variant for ECC support.)\n128GB of Kingstom Fury DDR4 @ 3200Mhz (non ECC)\n2x HP SSD EX900 1TB\n2x 8TB Seagate IronWolf NAS HDDs\n\nWhere I started\nMy idea is: \n\nThe two 8TB HDDs will work on the built-in btrfs raid1 mode.\nThe first of the two HP 1TB ssds will be for the root partition.\nThe other 1TB ssd will be for the virtual machines, qcow2, containers and volumes.\n\nI will create btrfs subvolumes on the raid1 hdds to store the home partition, snapshots and the logs, this is all to help me on my backup strategy which will come later.\nNAMEMAJ:MINRMSIZEROTYPEMOUNTPOINTS\nsda8:007.3T0disk\n└─sda18:107.3T0part/mnt/data\n/var/log\n/.snapshots\n/home\nsdb8:1607.3T0disk\n└─sdb18:1707.3T0part\nnvme1n1259:00931.5G0disk\n├─nvme1n1p1259:10600M0part/boot/efi\n├─nvme1n1p2259:201G0part/boot\nnvme0n1259:40953.9G0disk\n└─nvme1n1p3259:30929.9G0part/\n└─nvme0n1p1259:50929.9G0part/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay\n/var/lib/containers\n\nHow to achieve that? Frankly, it was not during installation... I actually did the most basic install of fedora workstation, the only thing I changed was making sure it used btrfs for everything. Later on the very first boot, through ssh I edited my fstab to properly mount those partitions the way I devised on this table. This table is actually the end result.\nWhy go over this trouble?\nBecause of snapshots! They are too good of a feature to not make use of. We need to separate the snapshot subvolume from the other subvolumes you want to backup. As the only thing I am interested is basically the home folder, this is the reason @snapshots and @home are siblins in the filesystem structure. With that, later I can use btrbk to make automated backups to an usb disk or another drive on one of the vacant hotswappable bays basically worry-free and unattended.\nBTRFS RAID1\nBTRFS has allocation profiles for different RAID modes that you can use. Have a read at this article if you want to know more, what interests me is that it has some key benefits over hardware raid, including in-place conversion. Which is actually the reason why I decided to do RAID1 and not RAID5 as I only have two disks for that on this server. This is no problem as I have a NAS with a more robust setup which makes backups of the server every two days, but if I do plan on making this even better down the line, I have the option to convert my raid1 into raid5 on the spot.\nThe syntax to create a RAID1 profile with your disks is very simple:\nmkfs.btrfs -mraid1 -draid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 -L data\nPer man page, you need to specify the profile for the metadata and the data, do that with the -m and -d flag respectively. Follow those with the disks or partitions you wish to use for the raid and -L to specify the disk label.\nAfter that, you can mount any of the disks on your filesystem and use your raid-enabled filesystem.\nBTRFS has an awesome functionality, called subvolumes. For all effects and purposes they are directories, but they have the power to be mounted as partitions on fstab... this is not the technical talk of course. I suggest reading the awesome BTRFS article on the arch wiki which was what helped me on this.\nThe fact that subvolumes can be used as partitions for mount is not a new thing of course, but I just used subvolumes exclusively for backups and never really touched this feature of the filesystem.\nI mounted the sda1 raid under /mnt/data so I could start creating the subvolumes and followed the @ notation for the subvolumes on the root of /mnt/data by doing:\nsudo btrfs subvolume create /mnt/data/@home\nsudo btrfs subvolume create /mnt/data/@snapshots\nsudo btrfs subvolume create /mnt/data/@var_log\n\nNext I needed the UUID of the partition where I created those subvolumes, I can do that easily with blkid like so:\n[root@fedora-server]# blkid /dev/sda1 \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"68490e94-b2e6-4c7f-9cb2-d25bcb6f31d9\" UUID_SUB=\"d5b6aa44-1632-4d10-86f9-9a9d01762cfe\" BLOCK_SIZE=\"4096\" TYPE=\"btrfs\" PARTUUID=\"0f18c33d-b627-7742-8739-399abff3f4f7\"\n\nI also did the same for the partition responsible to store the containers and volumes.\nWith that info, I manually edited my fstab to mount the subvolumes and set everything up correctly.\nUUID=68490e94-b2e6-4c7f-9cb2-d25bcb6f31d9 /mnt/data               btrfs                       0 0\nUUID=1cc8b713-e980-4017-ae3e-9098d8ae97f4 /var/lib/containers     btrfs   subvol=var_lib_containers 0 0\nUUID=68490e94-b2e6-4c7f-9cb2-d25bcb6f31d9 /home\t\t\t  btrfs   subvol=@home,compress=zstd:1 0 0\nUUID=68490e94-b2e6-4c7f-9cb2-d25bcb6f31d9 /.snapshots\t\t  btrfs   subvol=@snapshots 0 0\nUUID=68490e94-b2e6-4c7f-9cb2-d25bcb6f31d9 /var/log\t\t  btrfs   subvol=@var_log,compress=zstd:1 0 0\n\n\nAs you can see, we put in fstab the UUID of the disk that contains the subvolume we want to mount adding the specific subvolume name to the mount option subvol. After editing the file, it is wise to do systemctl daemon-reload to update the systemd units that are generated from fstab. Just reboot and you should have a machine ready to do the real fun stuff. \nLater on I will configure my containers, vms and explain my strategy on its usage on my workflow.\n","id":"https://brunosxs.com/posts/2023-06-19-making-a-home-server/","title":"Making a home server"},"https://brunosxs.com/posts/setting-up-raylib-raygui-with-cmake/":{"body":"Hey there. Back from the dead to add some useful scaffold.
